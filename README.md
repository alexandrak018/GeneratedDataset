--- | --- 
What do you think you could cut that down to? | [[1]](#1) |
I'd like to get your input on this. | [[1]](#1) |
Let's work on a small goal that you feel you can accomplish. | [[1]](#1) |
What goal would you like to set that you are willing to accomplish regarding your sugar consumption (e.g. cutting back on sugary drinks) | [[1]](#1) |
Would you like me to explain about how sugar works in the body? | [[2]](#2) |
I think you can do it! | [[3]](#3) |
Don’t worry! A lot of people who have come to use have been in the same state as you and are now doing much better. | [[3]](#3) |
I think you will be fine as well.  | [[3]](#3) |
What do you see as some not-so-good things if you continue consuming sugar as you are?   | [[4]](#4) |
That’s understandable. | [[5]](#5) |
And that’s certainly okay! You’re thinking about it, that’s already a first step.  | [[4]](#4) |
That’s great. You don’t have problems refraining from sugar. | [[4]](#4) |
You’ve really made a decision, that’s great.  | [[4]](#4) |
I do have some ideas why people might decide not to consume so much sugar, but what really matters is what is important to you. Just to brainstorm a bit, what according to you, would be a good thing about not consuming so much sugar?  | [[4]](#4) |
Those are some great points that you bring out, and I’m really glad you came up with these ideas. | [[4]](#4) |
So if you decide to improve your sugar consumption habits, how would you do it? | [[6]](#6) |
You don’t have to be 100% confident to get started, you just need enough confidence to take the first step. Give it a go! | [[6]](#6) |
It sounds like something that you know and feel like you can improve on in the next week. | [[7]](#7) |
On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 means having a balanced sugar intake is not at all important to you and 10 means having a balanced sugar intake is very important to you, how important is having a balanced sugar intake to you? | [[8]](#8) |
...That’s a really good reason.  | [[8]](#8) |
You are clearly a very resourceful person. | [[9]](#9) |
I appreciate your honesty. | [[10]](#10) |
Right. I hear you.  | [[5]](#5) |
It sounds like improving your sugar consumption is somewhat important to you.   | [[6]](#6) |
Good to know. Thank you for coming in today. Let’s talk again soon!  | [[5]](#5) |
Hmm. No need to worry if you don’t.  | [[5]](#5) |
How important would it be for you on a scale from 0 to 10 to do something about your sugar consumption?  | [[11]](#1) |
What do you drink when you are thirsty these nowadays?  | [[11]](#11) |
